' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Scheduler - Getting Started - Lesson 1 - Show appointments in read-only mode
' 
' This example demonstrates how to show appointments in a simple scheduling
' application using MVC Scheduling Extensions bound to data. We suggest that you
' review it if you are a first-time user of the ASP .NET MVC Scheduler.
' Note that
' the scheduler is in read-only mode to make the code easier to understand.
' This
' project is created by following the step-by-step guide of the Lesson 1 - Use
' Scheduler to Display Appointments in Read-Only Mode
' (ms-help://DevExpress.NETv12.1/DevExpress.AspNet/CustomDocument11554.htm).
' To
' learn how to implement the appointment editing functionality, review
' step-by-step guide in the Lesson 2 - Implement Insert-Update-Delete Appointment
' Functionality
' (ms-help://DevExpress.NETv12.1/DevExpress.AspNet/CustomDocument11567.htm) and
' see the result in the http://www.devexpress.com/scid=E3984 example.
